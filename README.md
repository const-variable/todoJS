# todoJS
Todo app in vanilla javascript
I have tried to follow MVC but it maybe not completely correct.

There are three main files
1. index.html
2. style.css
3. script.js

please ignore the other .js file as of now. 

In script.js 
 There are three classes. Model, View, Controller. 
 Model and View are connected by Controller.
 and everytime I create a new instace of a Controller, new List will be created. 
 
 But there is some problem with the list right now. Fix will be done in the following commits.
